# Toy Example: YouTube Spam Classifier

This is a repo with code for a spam classifier.
It was created during a couple of livecoding sessions in the Machine Learning for Statistical NLP course for the MLT masters at Gothenburg University.
I will aim to comment the code and have a finalized version sometime soon!
